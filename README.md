- 👋 Hi, I’m some guy who enjoys 'learning to code'. ;p
- 👀 I’m interested in caring for family, long walks, involved conversation. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning rust, go, python, C#, and php (maybe some C for installation purposes with clang).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on small projects, as a worker, to develop the ability to think with the code.
- 📫 How to reach me: 262-689-4533. developmentTool@protonmail.com.
